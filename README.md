# Jobly (Backend)

This is the backend / API for Jobly, and app where users can register/sign in, view available jobs/companies, and apply.

It was built as a lab project during my time at Rithm bootcamp.

To see the fullstack app with an optimized backend see https://github.com/DSom20/jobly-fullstack
